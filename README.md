# wordSearchApp
 a program that searches for a given word in the contents of a group of files

The program must ask the user to input:
I. A list of filenames on a single line, separated by commas.
II. A word to look for.
File names must be stored in a list, while the search word must be stored in a variable. The program
must display all lines that have the word, even as a substring of other words, not case sensitive. Each
line displayed must be preceded by the name of the file in which it is found
